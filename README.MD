Welcome to the `GHOSINT` repository, a comprehensive framework designed to streamline Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) operations. This repository houses a meticulously crafted template that guides users through the process of gathering, 
analyzing, and reporting information collected from publicly available sources.

## Introduction

The OSINT Template is tailored for researchers, cybersecurity professionals, investigative journalists, and anyone interested in the art and science of gathering information from open sources. 
It combines best practices, strategic methodologies, and a structured approach to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of OSINT activities.

## Features

- **Structured Methodology**: A step-by-step guide to conducting OSINT research, from planning to execution and reporting.
- **Checklists and Templates**: Ready-to-use checklists and templates to ensure thorough research and analysis.
- **Tool Recommendations**: A curated list of tools and software that are essential for OSINT investigations, categorized by use case.
- **Privacy and Security Tips**: Guidelines to maintain operational security (OpSec) and protect your digital footprint while conducting research.
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples demonstrating the application of the template in various scenarios.

## Getting Started with GHOSINT

Welcome to GHOSINT! To begin using GHOSINT, you have the option to use either the web version or the command-line interface (CLI). Please note that the CLI version is currently in beta and is far from complete, with only a few of the tools operational at this time. Detailed instructions and resources, including methodologies and tools, can be found at our [METHODOLOGY & TOOLS documentation](https://github.com/GHOST-7331/GHOSINT/blob/main/METHODOLOGY&TOOLS.MD).

### Using the Web Version

For most users, especially those new to GHOSINT or preferring a graphical interface, we recommend starting with the web version. It's ready to use without the need for installation. Access it directly through the documentation link provided above.

### Getting Started with the CLI (Beta)

For those who prefer using the command line or wish to test the beta version of our CLI, be aware that the CLI is currently in development and only a limited number of tools are functional. Follow these steps to get it up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the GHOSINT repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GHOST-7331/GHOSINT.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the CLI directory:
    ```bash
    cd GHOSINT/cli
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 install.py
    ```

4. Run GHOSINT via CLI:
    ```bash
    python3 ghosint.py
    ```

Given the CLI's beta status and limited functionality, please proceed with caution. Your feedback on this version will be invaluable for our ongoing development efforts.
