Here's a breakdown of the most used Google Dork queries, which can be incredibly handy for digging up information. These queries let you do a bunch of stuff like finding specific files, spying on your competition, 
tracking down people, sniffing out SEO backlinks, piecing together email lists, and spotting web vulnerabilities.

Let's dive into the top Google Dorks and their uses:

cache: This dork pulls up the cached version of any site. For example, cache:securitytrails.com.

allintext: This one searches for specific text on any webpage. Like, allintext: hacking tools.

allintitle: Similar to allintext, but it zeroes in on page titles containing your search terms. Example: allintitle:"Security Companies".

allinurl: This fetches pages with URLs that include all your specified characters. Try allinurl:clientarea.

filetype: If you're after specific file types, this is your go-to. To hunt for PDFs, you'd use email security filetype: pdf.

inurl: Just like allinurl, but for when you've got just one keyword in mind. Example: inurl:admin.

intitle: Great for keyword hunting in page titles. intitle:security tools will find titles starting with "security," with "tools" elsewhere on the page.

inanchor: This one's for finding exact anchor texts in links. Example: inanchor:"cyber security".

intext: Handy for locating pages with specific text or strings. For instance, intext:"safe internet".

site: Shows all indexed URLs for a given domain or subdomain, like site:securitytrails.com.

*: The wildcard, for when you're open to "anything" related to your search term. how to * a website could bring up various actions related to websites.

|: The logical OR operator. Searching "security" "tips" finds pages with either "security," "tips," or both.

+: Use this to link words together, useful for finding pages that hit on multiple specifics. Example: security + trails.

-: The minus sign helps filter out unwanted results. security -trails would ignore pages mentioning "trails."
