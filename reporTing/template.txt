TLP Info: 

The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) is a set of designations used to ensure that sensitive information is shared with the appropriate audience. It employs four colors to indicate different levels of sensitivity and distribution restrictions:

TLP:RED - Information labeled TLP:RED is highly sensitive and should only be disclosed to individuals within a specific group or organization. It should not be shared outside of the context in which it was originally disclosed, even if someone outside the group could benefit from the information.

TLP:AMBER - TLP:AMBER information is meant for limited distribution, to be shared only with individuals who have a need to know and who understand their obligation to handle the information as sensitive. This might include participants in a specific project or members of a specific organization.

TLP:GREEN - Information marked as TLP:GREEN is limited to community-wide information sharing. This means that the information can be shared within the broader community, but not with the general public.

TLP:WHITE (or TLP: CLEAR in some variations) - TLP:WHITE information can be shared with the general public without restriction.
